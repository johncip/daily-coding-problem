arrays

1. product of other elements
  - trick: keep a running product
  - it's the running product * product of the rest
  - also you can get it down to O(n) by precomputing "suffix" products from the right

2. smallest sort window
  - right bound is the *last* element that is < a running max (check from left)
  - left bound is the *last* element that is > a running min (check from right)
  - trick: don't assume you have to check for the left bound from the left (etc.)

3. maximum subarray sum
  - trick: imagine that you are computing and storing the max subarray sum *up to* each i.
  - this is max(prev_sum, 0) + arr[i]
  - trick: note that you can store them in a single variable, by only keeping the max around
  - so it's the maximum of each of the "max up to i"
